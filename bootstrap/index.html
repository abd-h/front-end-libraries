                Bootstrap is a front end framework used to design responsive web pages and applications. It takes a mobile-first
                approach to web development, and includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, plus some JavaScript functionality.
        
                In this course, you'll learn how to build responsive websites with Bootstrap, and use its included classes to
                style
                buttons, images, forms, navigation, and other common elements.

                In the HTML5 and CSS section of freeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App.
                Now let's go back to it. This time, we'll style
                it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework.
        
                Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name
                responsive
                design.
        
                With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on
                devices with screens of any width.
        
                You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:
        
                Note that using either > or /> to close the link tag is acceptable.
        
                To get started, we should nest all of our HTML (except the link tag and the style element) in a div element with
                the
                class container-fluid.
